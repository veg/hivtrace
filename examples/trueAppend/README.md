# Synthetic datasets

Based off over 12,000 LANL pol sequences.

## Network data
`Network` denotes data that is used to either build or append to a network.

`New` or `Old` denotes thats that are either recent enough to trigger automated priority set creation or not, respectively.

Numbers `1`, `2`, `3` denote the order in which they should be used.

## Quality control

`QC` denotes data that is used for the homology screening.

## Both

`Small` datasets are useful for development and testing; should run in under a minute.

`Large` datasets will take longer but contain a more realistic amount of sequences.

HIV-TRACE
==========

HIV-TRACE is an application that identifies potential transmission
clusters within a supplied FASTA file with an option to find
potential links against the Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database. 

# Installation

## System Dependencies

* gcc >= 6.0.0
* python3 >= 3.5.1
* tn93 >= 1.0.6

HIV-TRACE requires [tn93](https://github.com/veg/tn93) be installed and python3.

## Install using pip

```
pip3 install biopython
pip3 install numpy==1.20
pip3 install scipy
pip3 install cython
pip3 install hivtrace
```

Tested with Python `3.5.1`, `3.5.3`, `3.6.1`, and `3.9.*`.

# Example Usage

`hivtrace -i ./INPUT.FASTA -a resolve -r HXB2_prrt -t .015 -m 500 -g .05 -c`

# Options Summary

## -i --input

A FASTA file, with **nucleotide** sequences to be analyzed. Each sequence will
be aligned to the chosen reference sequence prior to network inference.
Sequence names may include munged attributes, 
e.g. ISOLATE_XYZ|2005|SAN DIEGO|MSM

## -a --ambiguities

Handle ambiguious nucleotides using one of the following specified strategies.

| Option    | Description                                                                  |
| --------- | --------------                                                               |
| resolve   | count any resolutions that match as a perfect match                          |
| average   | average all possible resolutions                                             |
| skip      | skip all positions with ambiguities                                          |
| gapmm     | count character-gap positions as 4-way mismatches, otherwise same as average |

## -r --reference

The sequence that will be used to align all provided sequences to. It is assumed that
the input sequences are in fact homologous to the reference and do not have too
much indel variation.

## -t --threshold

Two sequences will be connected with a putative link (subject to filtering, see
below), if and only if their pairwise distance does not exceed this threshold.

## -m --minoverlap

Only sequences who overlap by at least this many non-gap characters will be
included in distance calculations. Be sure to adjust this based on the length
of the input sequences. You should aim to have at least 2/(distance threshold)
aligned characters.

## -g --fraction

Affects _only_ the **Resolve** option for handling ambiguities.
Any sequence with no more than the selected proportion [0 - 1] will have its
ambiguities resolved (if possible), and ambiguities in sequences with higher
fractions of them will be averaged. This mitigates spurious linkages due to
highly ambiguous sequences.

## -u --curate

Screen for contaminants by marking or removing sequences that cluster with any of the contaminant IDs.

| Option     | Description                                                     |
| ---------  | --------------                                                  |
| remove     | Remove spurious edges from the inferred network                 |
| report     | Flag all sequences sharing a cluster with the reference         |
| separately | Flag all sequences and report them via secondary tn93 command   |
| none       | Do nothing                                                      |



## -f --filter

Use a phylogenetic test of conditional independence on each triangle in the
network to remove spurious _transitive_ connections which make
A->B->C chains look like A-B-C triangles. 

| Option     | Description                                                     |
| ---------  | --------------                                                  |
| remove     | reports supurious _transitive_ connections                      |
| report     | removes supurious _transitive_ connections                      |


## -s --strip_drams

Masks known DRAMs (Drug Resistance-Associated Mutation) positions from provided sequences.

| Option    | Description                                                                                                                                      |
| --------- | --------------                                                                                                                                   |
| lewis     | Mask (with ---) the list of codon sites defined in [Lewis et al](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0050050). |
| wheeler   | Mask (with ---) the list of codon sites defined in [Wheeler et al](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20395786).                                 |

 
## -c --compare

Compare uploaded sequences to all public sequences. 
Retrieved periodically from the [Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database](http://hiv.lanl.gov)

## -o --output
Specify output filename. If no output filename is provided, then the output filename will be <input_filename>.results.json
